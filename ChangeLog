2001-04-11  Mike Melanson <melanson@pcisys.net>

	* final modifications for v0.75 release

	* removed HACKING file from the distribution for the time being
	due to lack of completeness

	* updated NEWS, README, configure.in, Makefile.in

2001-04-11  Mike Melanson <melanson@pcisys.net>

	* sound.h, io.c: removed dead sound_data structure

	* [all source code files]: added a new uniform file header

2001-04-09  Mike Melanson <melanson@pcisys.net>

	* BUGS, HACKING: Updated some documention

2001-03-27  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* README, INSTALL.BSD: Update notes to reflect NetBSD compatibility.

2001-03-27  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* configure.in, sound.c, w.c, x11.c: Fix the endian problems for
	now.

2001-03-27  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* sound.c, w.c, x11.c: Fix some more endian.h fun.  Still needs
	more work, but at least it fixes an inclusion problem on NetBSD for
	now.  But the macros and definitions are still not usable.  This is
	due to some platforms trying to fix namespace pollution by prefixing
	the definitions with underscores.

2001-03-26  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* configure.in: Add some more tests to ease compilation across
	systems, this includes tests for: strtod(), strtoul(), inline
	definition, const definition, signal return type, sys/wait problems
	and more.  Removed the awk test. Also removed the ln -s test.

2001-03-23  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* configure.in, sound.c: Solve the inline problem more gracefully
	by checking for it in configure, and define it appropriately in
	config.h.

2001-03-22  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* sound.c: Fix around lameness and brokeness in the GNU C compiler,
	which requires us to specify __inline__ instead of inline, which is
	only the ANSI C specified function specifier.

2001-03-22  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* sound.c, x11.c: FreeBSD, and possibly other platforms,
	do not have an <endian.h>, but often have a <machine/endian.h>.
	This needs to become a configure thinghy later on.

2001-03-14  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* sound.c: Get rid of superfluous semi-colons.

2001-03-14  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* sound.c: Properly prototype shift_register15().

2001-03-14  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* sound.c: ANSI C does not allow empty initialiser braces.

2001-03-14  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* HACKING: Add comment about comments.

2001-03-14  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* mapper.c, sound.c: Replace C99 comments with C89 comments
	or #if 0/#endif constructs.

2001-03-13  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>
	* io.c: Fix C99 comments to a #if/#endif pair.

	* sound.c: Minor change to noise channel step counter

2001-03-01  Paul Zaremba <pez@treeofice.2y.net>
	* emu.c: Fixed "device busy" error for sound start

	with Zelda II title), changed header comment style

2001-03-01  Mike Melanson <melanson@pcisys.net>

	* fb.c mapper.c, pixels.h, x86.S: added MMC4 support

2001-02-28  Mike Melanson <melanson@pcisys.net>

	* emu.c, Makefile.am, added unzip.c, unzip.h, ziploader.c,
	ziploader.h: added zip support, courtesy of Kevin Lindsay
	<klindsay@mkintraweb.com>

	* README: updated to explain compressed file support and revised
	sound support

	* Added HACKING file which will serve as a guide for developers

	* emu.c: sound is now enabled by default and there are special
	files ('mute' and 'none') to specify no sound with the --sound
	option

	* emu.c, sound.c, sound.h, x11.c, ggi.c, w.c: removed references
	to options to generate sine waves in place of square wave; the
	square waves work great now and the sine wave generation appears
	to be gone now

2001-02-27  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>

	* configure.in: Fix configure script to be smarter than the
	automake/autoconf stuff which automatically sets CFLAGS to
	a braindead setting of -O2, while it is known that
	optimisationlevels greater than -O are known to produce
	broken code on certain architectures [Alpha] with gcc.

2001-02-26  Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven <asmodai@wxs.nl>

	* configure.in: Update warnings to latest.

2001-02-05  Paul Zaremba <pez@treeofice.2y.net>

	* Sound Fixes
	Fixed Typo in sound.c - MegaMan2/Metal Man now sounds correct.
	Determined that noise Dropout in Zelda/16 bit mode is a
	problem with my laptop sound card (sounds fine on my desktop).
	Default output changed to 44100Hz 8bit.
	Updated help to reflect current state of sound.

2000-11-16  Paul Zaremba <pez@treeofice.2y.net>

	* More sound fixes:

	(sq?), Triangle channel sounds better (note length appears to be fixed)

2000-10-31  The Mighty Mike Master <melanson@pcisys.net>

	* tweaked MMC3 support so that it actually supports a 16K-PRG/8K-CHR
	MMC3 ROM (pedagogical exercise)

	* sound fixes courtesy of Paul Zaremba <pez@treeofice.2y.net>:
	Duty cycle fixed for square channels, 120/240hz timing problems
