/* first 64 colours are set, and they are stored in triplets... i.e. */
/* RGB, RGB, RGB.  Each byte is an 8 bit colour value. */
/* Luma values were measured from my NES using the chroma/luma seperator */
/* on the filter matrix from Portendo's colour decoder board. */
/* A value of 1.0 was assigned to the brightest white which is colour */

/* Chroma was found to be constant for all colours, which is what I */
/* expected.  I fudged this at .5 which seemed to be about right. (see */
/* farther down for more details on this) */
/* The last thing I will do will be figure out what those intensity */
/* and monochrome bits *really* do. :-)  Stay tuned for that at a */
