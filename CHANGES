Changes to TuxNES are recorded in the ChangeLog file. Here is the
CHANGES file from the latest release of Nestra, some of which are also
present in TuxNES:


Changes in version 0.66:

 Emulate the behavior of the bits which are shared between 2005/2006

 Fixed the stuff that I broke in the last version

 Fixed STA addr,X and STA addr,Y instructions

 Added -i option to ignore unknown instructions

 Added -s option to allocate static colormap on 8-bit displays

 X11 keysym support (thanks Ben Sittler)


Changes in version 0.65:

 Allow the decimal mode bit to be set even tho it doesn't do anything.

 Improved support for self-modifying code.

 Some fixes to the mid-hblank and video registers.

 MMC1 ROM address masking.

 MMC3 VROM address masking, and ignore low bit for 2k pages. 


Changes in version 0.64:

 Added nesticle-type palette support (Thanks Ben Sittler)

 512-byte trainer support (also thanks to Ben Sittler)

 Some minor changes for FreeBSD.

 Fixed ROL instruction.

 Fixed one-screen mirror bug.

 Fixed VRAM palette mirroring bug.

 Fixed interrupts and RTI instruction.

 Fixed a sprite DMA bug.


Changes in version 0.63:

 Mapper 7 (RARE/AOROM) support

 More support for self-modifying code

 Cleaned up the memory allocation a bit

 Save games can be stored in $HOME/.nestra/


Changes in version 0.62:

 Mapper 11 and partial mapper 9 support (thanks Kristoffer Brånemyr)

 Reload code after mapper switch (should fix -l problems)

 Fixed a MMC3 bug.

 Minor bugfix to mid-hblank updates.


Changes in version 0.61:

 No scanline IRQs while the display is off.

 Fixed some problems with the sprite 0 hit flag.

 NMI occurs on scanline 241, not at the end of line 239.

 Sprite DMA takes 514 CPU cycles.

 Handle V-scroll values greater than 240 like a real NES does.


Changes in version 0.6:

 MMC3 IRQ support added.

 New video code draws pixmap directly instead of calling xlib, which should
 improve accuracy and portability.  It's a bit slower tho.

 Self-modifying indirect jump instruction is now handled properly.

 Corrected cycle count for branches which cross page boundary.


Changes in version 0.51:

 Corrected one-screen VRAM mirroring

 VRAM mirroring can now be set via command line options


Changes in version 0.5:

 Split-screen character table switch is implemented

 Sprite transparency is correct now (a bit expensive in CPU time tho)

 Differential redraw is implemented (only changed scanlines are redrawn)

 Disassembly is now a command line option

 Minor updates to the dynamic recompiler + eliminated some compiler warnings


Changes in version 0.41:

 Cleaned up a few compiler warnings

 Some timing fixes

 Merged 16/24-bit color pallettes


Changes in version 0.4:

 Simplified background cache and rewrote sprite code to improve performance
 and fix several bugs.

 Support for 512K MMC1 and various mapper fixes.


Changes in version 0.32:

 Speed control added.

 Various mapper fixes.

 Preliminary support for self-modifying code.


Changes in version 0.31:

 Implemented BRK instruction and various bug fixes.


Changes in version 0.3:

 Support for 8-bit color displays and fixed some graphical glitches.


Changes in version 0.2:

 Improved pattern matching for the dynamic recompiler

 Completed background caching for better performance


Changes in version 0.15:

 Corrected some cycle timings.

 Corrected several mapper bugs.

 Began work on window resizing (still incomplete)

 Reworked background display code to cache multiple pixmaps - this can be
 activated by changing #define tilecachedepth; there are some bugs still tho.


Changes in version 0.1:

 First release.
